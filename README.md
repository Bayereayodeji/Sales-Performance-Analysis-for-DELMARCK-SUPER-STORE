# Sales-Performance-Analysis-for-DELMARCK-SUPER-STORE
This analysis, spanning an entire year of sales data, focuses on uncovering key sales trends, identifying top-performing products, recognizing outstanding sales representatives, pinpointing the best customer and region, and highlighting the leading shipping city.

I recently conducted a comprehensive Sales Performance Analysis for DELMARCK SUPER STORE during my ongoing data analytics training at Vephla University (Data School). This analysis, covering a full year of sales data, aimed at identifying key sales trends, top-performing products, outstanding sales representatives, the best customer and region, and the leading shipping city. The analysis also uncovered underperforming areas, including low-performing months and sales representatives, and provided actionable recommendations to enhance future performance.

Key Insights:
1.	Top Performing Month: December 2023, with a total of $60.3K in sales out of $430K in total revenue.
2.	Sales Representative of the Year: Nancy Frenchafer, with $104.2K in sales, representing a substantial share of the $430K total revenue.
3.	Best Region of the Year: North region, generating $141.6K in revenue.
4.	Product of the Year: Coffee, which brought in $75.4K in total revenue.
5.	Best Customer of the Year: Company D, with a total purchase value of $67.1K.
6.	Leading Shipping City: New York, with purchases totaling $67.1K.
7.	
Areas of Concern:
1.	Underperforming Month: February 2023 recorded the lowest sales, generating only $14.5K, which is significantly below the yearly total of $430K.
2.	Underperforming Sales Representative: Jan Kotas, with only $16.3K in total sales out of $430K, performed well below expectations.
3.	
Recommendations:
1.	Investigate Low Sales in February 2023: Further analysis is needed to determine the root causes of the poor performance in February, to prevent similar declines in the future.
2.	Staff Development for Underperforming Representatives: Implement targeted training and development programs for sales representatives like Jan Kotas, incorporating best practices from high performers such as Nancy Frenchafer, to boost overall team performance.
